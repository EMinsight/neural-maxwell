This was a final project for Stanford's [CS229](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) course in machine learning. I designed an unsupervised machine learning model for computing approximate electromagnetic fields in a cavity containing an arbitrary spatial dielectric permit- tivity distribution. The model achieves good predictive performance and is over 10Ã— faster than identically-sized finite-difference frequency-domain simulations, suggesting possible applications for accelerating optical inverse design algorithms.
